Hack-A-Day is a project I'm doing in November, where I try to make 30 new projects, in 30 days.

# Day 07: Hack-An-Asteroid

This is an asteroid clone. There are 4 levels of increasing difficulty.

Controls: Mouse to aim, W or up-arrow to accelerate, left click to shoot.

Fun fact, my original plan for this one was to just let the asteroids keep splitting forever, as a joke.
